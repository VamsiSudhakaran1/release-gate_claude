## What is release-gate?

release-gate blocks AI agent deployment unless you can prove:

✅ **Request Contract is Validated** - Schema defined and tested with valid/invalid samples
✅ **Operational Safeguards are Declared** - Kill switch, fallback, ownership, runbook present
✅ **Access Control is Enforced** - Authentication and rate limiting configured
✅ **Resource Budgets are Set** - Token, retry, cost, and concurrency limits defined
✅ **Governance Policies are Met** - System meets your organization's requirements
✅ **Audit Evidence is Generated** - Machine-readable proof for compliance

---

## The Problem

Autonomous AI agents fail in production in ways traditional testing can't catch:

- **Non-owner access** (Agents of Chaos #2) - Anyone can execute commands
- **Self-destruction** (Agents of Chaos #1) - Agent deletes its own infrastructure
- **Resource exhaustion** (Agents of Chaos #4, #5) - Infinite loops consume tokens
- **Identity spoofing** (Agents of Chaos #8) - Governance bypassed via usernames
- **Manipulation** (Agents of Chaos #7) - Agents exploited into harmful behavior

**Traditional QA asks:** "Does it work?"
**release-gate asks:** "Is it safe to run unsupervised?"

These are different questions that require different tools.

**Reference:** [Agents of Chaos: Red-Teaming of Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20021)

---

## What release-gate Does (v0.2)

### ✅ INPUT_CONTRACT Check

Ensures your agent's request format is well-defined and tested.

**Validates:**
- Schema is defined and syntactically valid ✅
- All valid test samples pass the schema ✅
- All invalid test samples fail the schema ✅

### ✅ FALLBACK_DECLARED Check

Ensures operational safety mechanisms are documented.

**Validates:**
- Kill switch is declared (how to disable) ✅
- Fallback mode is specified (what happens if it fails) ✅
- Ownership is assigned (who's responsible) ✅
- Runbook URL is provided (incident response) ✅

### ✅ IDENTITY_BOUNDARY Check (v0.2 NEW)

Ensures your agent enforces proper access control and rate limiting.

**Validates:**
- Authentication is required or explicitly allowed ✅
- Rate limits are configured per user/client ✅
- Data isolation boundaries are defined ✅

### ✅ ACTION_BUDGET Check (v0.2 NEW)

Ensures your agent has guardrails on resource consumption and costs.

**Validates:**
- Max tokens per request is defined ✅
- Max retries per request is defined ✅
- Max daily/monthly cost is defined ✅
- Max concurrent requests is defined ✅

---

## What release-gate Does NOT Do (v0.2)

These features are planned for future versions:

❌ **Runtime behavior testing** - Doesn't execute the agent
❌ **Output validation** - Doesn't test actual outputs or model behavior
❌ **Formal verification** - Doesn't mathematically verify behavior
❌ **Runtime monitoring** - Doesn't continuously verify at runtime

---

## How It Fits in Your Stack

### With Any Tool
release-gate **doesn't care what testing framework you use**. It integrates with any tool or custom validators:

**Works with:**
- ✅ Unit tests (pytest, Jest, unittest, etc.)
- ✅ Integration tests (any framework)
- ✅ Agent evaluators (LangSmith, Evals, custom)
- ✅ Behavior testers (simulation frameworks)
- ✅ Custom validators (your own code)

**Full workflow:**
1. Test agent behavior (any framework/tool)
2. Document results in release-gate.yaml
3. release-gate validates governance policies
4. CI/CD blocks or approves deployment

### With Observability Tools
- **Testing/Evaluation:** Any framework (LangSmith, custom evals, unit tests)
- **Pre-deployment policy:** Use release-gate ← You are here
- **Production monitoring:** Use DataDog, New Relic, CloudWatch, etc.
- **Incident response:** Use runbooks referenced in release-gate.yaml

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install pyyaml jsonschema
```

### 2. Initialize

```bash
python cli.py init --project my-system
```

Creates:
- `release-gate.yaml` - Configuration template
- `valid_requests.jsonl` - Valid request examples
- `invalid_requests.jsonl` - Invalid request examples

### 3. Run

```bash
python cli.py run --config release-gate.yaml --format text
```

Expected output:

```
input_contract: ✓ PASS
fallback_declared: ✓ PASS

Overall Decision: ✓ PASS
Exit Code: 0 (safe to deploy)
```

---

## Configuration

### Minimal Example

```yaml
project:
  name: my-agent
  version: 1.0.0

checks:
  input_contract:
    enabled: true
    schema:
      type: object
      required: [prompt]
      properties:
        prompt:
          type: string
          minLength: 1
    samples:
      valid_path: valid_requests.jsonl
      invalid_path: invalid_requests.jsonl

  fallback_declared:
    enabled: true
    kill_switch:
      type: feature_flag
      name: disable_my_agent
    fallback:
      mode: static_placeholder
    ownership:
      team: platform-team
      oncall: oncall-platform
    runbook_url: https://wiki.internal/runbooks/my-agent
```

See [examples/](examples/) for complete examples.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Status | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| 0 | PASS | All checks passed, safe to deploy |
| 10 | WARN | Warnings found, review recommended |
| 1 | FAIL | Critical failures, deployment blocked |

**CI/CD Integration:**

```bash
python cli.py run --config release-gate.yaml

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  deploy_to_production
elif [ $? -eq 10 ]; then
  send_for_approval
else
  exit 1  # Deployment blocked
fi
```

## Design Philosophy

### 1. Governance ≠ Testing

Testing asks: "Does it work?"
Governance asks: "Is it safe to run?"

release-gate focuses on governance.

### 2. Policy-as-Code

Safety requirements are declared in YAML and validated before deployment.

### 3. Local-First

No external services, no data transmission, no back-end infrastructure.

### 4. Automation Over Checklists

Checklists can be skipped. CI/CD gates cannot.

### 5. Pluggable Checks

Extensible system for adding governance controls:
- INPUT_CONTRACT (v0.1)
- FALLBACK_DECLARED (v0.1)
- IDENTITY_BOUNDARY (v0.2)
- ACTION_BUDGET (v0.2)
- APPROVAL_REQUIRED (v0.3)
- DATA_EGRESS_POLICY (v0.3)

---

## The Vision

**release-gate is the OPA / SonarQube / admission-controller layer for AI agents.**

- OPA enforces infrastructure policies
- SonarQube enforces code quality policies
- release-gate enforces AI agent governance policies

Expect governance to become as important as testing in the AI era.

## What release-gate Does (v0.1)

### ✅ Validates INPUT_CONTRACT

Ensures your agent's request format is well-defined and tested.

**Checks:**
- ✅ Schema is defined and syntactically valid
- ✅ All valid test samples pass the schema
- ✅ All invalid test samples fail the schema

**Example:**
```yaml
input_contract:
  enabled: true
  schema:
    type: object
    required: [prompt, duration_sec]
    properties:
      prompt:
        type: string
        minLength: 1
        maxLength: 1000
      duration_sec:
        type: number
        minimum: 1
        maximum: 60
  samples:
    valid_path: valid_requests.jsonl
    invalid_path: invalid_requests.jsonl
```

### ✅ Validates FALLBACK_DECLARED

Ensures operational safety mechanisms are documented.

**Checks:**
- ✅ Kill switch is declared (how to disable)
- ✅ Fallback mode is specified (what happens if it fails)
- ✅ Ownership is assigned (who's responsible)
- ✅ Runbook URL is provided (incident response)

**Example:**
```yaml
fallback_declared:
  enabled: true
  kill_switch:
    type: feature_flag
    name: disable_my_agent
  fallback:
    mode: static_placeholder
  ownership:
    team: platform-team
    oncall: oncall-platform
  runbook_url: https://wiki.internal/runbooks/my-agent
```
